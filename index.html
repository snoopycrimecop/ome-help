<p><span class="bold">Using ImageJ with OMERO</span></p>

<p>The way that OMERO.insight-ij, the ImageJ plugin, uses Bio-Formats has changed. To use ImageJ with OMERO 5.0.x you now need bioformats_package.jar in the plugins folder, to replace loci_tools.jar, which must be removed.</p>
<p>Fiji now ships with Bio-Formats 5 by default so you can use it with the OMERO.insight-ij plugin version 5.0.x without needing to update anything.</p>
<p>Full details of how to use OMERO with ImageJ and Fiji for both versions 5.0.5 and 4.4.12, and how to upgrade, are shown in the <a href="imagej.html">Using ImageJ with OMERO</a> section.</p>
