<h2>Java Web Start has been removed from 5.2</h2>

<p>Due to Java no longer supporting Web Start and increasing compatibility issues, Java Web Start for OMERO.insight has been removed from version 5.2. It remains in version 5.1.4, but has been deprecated, so no further work, including security patching will be done on it.</p>
