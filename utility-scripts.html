<p>As well as scripts for exporting images and figures, OMERO.insight also
includes &#8216;Util Scripts&#8217; to add other functionality.</p>

<h2>Channel offsets</h2>

<p><a class="external-url" href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/snapshots/movies/omero-4-3/mov/ChannelOffsets-4.3.mov">MOVIE: channel offsets demo</a></p>

<p>The Channel Offsets script allows you to apply X, Y and Z offsets to
individual channels in an image, creating a new image in the process.
You can pick which of the channels from the source image to combine in
the new image (up to the first 4 channels). The script can process
several images at once, placing the new images in the same Dataset as
the source images by default, or in a new Dataset if the &#8220;New Dataset
Name&#8221; parameter is filled out.</p>

<h2>Dataset to Plate</h2>

<p><a class="external-url" href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/snapshots/movies/omero-4-3/mov/Dataset_To_Plate-4.3.2.mov">MOVIE: Dataset to Plate demo</a></p>

<p>This script allows you to create a &#8220;Plate&#8221; from an ordered set of images
in a Dataset, assigning images to a row and column based on their
sequence by name. You can arrange images by row or column, choose the
size of the row or column and how they are named.</p>

<p><a class="external-url" href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/snapshots/movies/omero-4-3/mov/Combine_Images.mov">MOVIE: Combine Images demo</a>.  Slightly older movie
<a class="external-url" href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/snapshots/movies/omero-4-2/mov/Scripting1.mov">here</a>.</p>

<p>This script takes a number of single-plane images or image Z-stacks,
identified either by <cite>Image_ID</cite> or by the ID of the Dataset that contains
them. All input images should have the same X, Y and Z dimensions and
are expected to have a single channel and time-point. If you want to use a
subset of the images, choose the &#8220;Filter Names&#8221; option by entering some
text. Only image names that contain this text will be used.</p>

<p>There are 2 alternative methods you can use to define which images are
assigned to which Z, T or C index in the new image and how big the new
dimensions are (see below).</p>

<p>Optionally you can specify colors and names for the channels in the new
image.</p>

</div><!-- End section -->

<div class="section" id="auto-define-dimensions">
<h3>Auto define dimensions</h3>

<p>This option is chosen by default. This method uses the names of each
image to try and identify the Z, T or C index. The user should choose
the naming pattern for each dimension. For example, if you want to
combine images named like these:</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">

<li>image001_C01_Z01.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C01_Z02.tiff</span></tt></li>
</ul>

<p>you should choose: * Channel Name Pattern: &#8220;_C&#8221; * Z Name Pattern:
&#8220;_Z&#8221; * Time Name Pattern: &#8220;None&#8221; (optional)</p>

<p>If the input images are Z stacks, then the &#8216;Z Name Pattern&#8217; will be
ignored and the Z-size of the first image will be used instead.</p>

<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">Note</p>
<p class="note-text">It is assumed that all images have the same Z size.</p>

</div><!-- End note -->

<div class="section" id="manually-define-dimensions">
<h3>Manually define dimensions</h3>

<p>With this option, the images are combined in the same order that they
appear when sorted alphabetically (default in OMERO.insight). If you want to
stitch the planes in a single dimension (e.g. time) then you only need
to choose &#8220;Time&#8221; as the Dimension 1 value and this will do the job.</p>

<p>If you want to stitch the planes across 2 or more dimensions, you need
to specify the dimensions in the order that they change in the list of
input images. For example, images named like this:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">

<li>image001_C01_Z01.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C01_Z02.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C01_Z03.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C01-Z04.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C01-Z05.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C02-Z01.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C02-Z02.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C02-Z03.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C02-Z04.tiff</span></tt></li>

<li>image001_C02-Z05.tiff</span></tt></li>
</ul>

<p>The first dimension to change is Z (changes between images 1,2,3,4,5 in
the list) and the second dimension to change is Channel (changes between
images 5 and 6).</p>

<p>You must specify the Dimensions that these images represent in the
combined image, in the order that they change in the sorted list. In the
above example, Dimension_1 would be &#8220;Z&#8221;, since this changes first, and
Dimension_2 is &#8220;Channel&#8221;. It is also necessary to specify the Size of
the dimensions. In this case, &#8220;size Z&#8221; is 5 and &#8220;size C&#8221; is 2. It is
possible to omit the size of the last dimension since this can be
calculated by the script.</p>

<p>If the input images are Z stacks, you do not need to specify a Z
dimension (it will be ignored if you do).</p>
