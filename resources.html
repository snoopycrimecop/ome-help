<p>For users in the University of Dundee School of Life Sciences, there are some pages aimed specifically at users of Nightshade, the SLS OMERO server.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

<p>Omnigraffle&reg; files for the creation of the screenshots used in the User Help website and other resources such as Word&reg; files can be downloaded from the Help resources directory on the OME Downloads site:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/resources/" target="_blank">Training Materials Resources</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Pdfs are no longer being produced for each version but if you have a particular requirement for them for training purposes, please <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>There are also movie tutorials on the OME YouTube Channel:</p>

<p>If you would like to build your own version of the User Help website, it is easily done using Jekyll, which is very quick to learn.</p>

<p>Simply clone the code from the ome-help GitHub repository and you are away:</p>

</ul>

<p>The Github <a href="https://github.com/openmicroscopy/ome-help#omero-user-help-guides" target="_blank">Readme</a> file explains the architecture of the website.</p>
