<p>It is convenient to put together material for OMERO training sessions from some of the resources and PDFs available on the website.</p>

<p>We suggest using an A5 &#39;Getting Started with OMERO&#39; brochure which can be customised with your institution's server details. Generic UK and USA versions are in the downloads folder <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/resources/a5-brochure/" target="_blank">a5-brochure</a>, as Word&reg; Docs for editing, or as generic PDFs.</p>

<p>This generally helps the participants in the training session to get started and logged in with minimal confusion.</p>

<p>You can also select appropriate sections in the User Help website, and download the individual PDFs of the pages using the link at the top right of each page. These have been formatted for printing.</p>

<p>Alternatively all the PDFs available for both OMERO versions can be downloaded as a zip archive using the links below.</p>

<ul>

<li>All User Guides for <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/archives/OMERO_User_Guides_5_1_1.zip">Version 5.1.1</a> (Zipped PDFs 144 MB)</li>
<br/>
  
<li>All User Guides for <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/archives/OMERO_User_Guides_5_0_8.zip">Version 5.0.8</a> (Zipped PDFs 185 MB)</li>

</ul>
  
<p>For users in the University of Dundee College of Life Sciences, there are some pages aimed specifically at users of Nightshade, the CLS OMERO server.</p>

<ul>

  <li>CLS Nightshade <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/pdfs/cls-public.pdf" target="_blank">Public Sharing Instructions</a> and <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/cls-public-demo.html" target="_blank">Demo Site</a></li>
  <br/>

</ul>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>Omnigraffle&reg; and Word&reg; files used for the creation of the screenshots used in the Guides and the PDFs of the Guides are located in the <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/help/resources/" target="_blank">resources</a> directory. </p>
